## Development Note ##

Most documents contain resource paths relative to the server root (starting
with `/`). This means that the site is best tested from a web server. One simple
way to get one running, is issuing the command `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
(for Python 2) from the `site` directory.

Note that documents include a Google Analytics snippet, which you want to remove or modify for before reuse.
